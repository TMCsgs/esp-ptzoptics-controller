# esp-ptzoptics-controller
The goal of this project is to develop a cost-effective controller as an alternative to the traditional, often expensive joysticks offered by PTZOptics. This provides an affordable solution for controlling your cameras.

To use this project, simply connect two joysticks to an esp32 or arduino. If you are using two cameras, you can optionally integrate an additional display and/or two LEDs for status indication.
